## Context

In the evolution of digital identity management, the [OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) has been a pivotal standard, providing secure delegated access to resources. Yet, a newer paradigm is emerging that promises to revolutionize how identities are managed online: **the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**. 

SSI positions the individual at the center of the digital identity narrative, providing a more personal and autonomous approach to identity management.

> Boruta's team is currently conducting R&D work for the development of SSI solutions in addition to the OAuth 2.0 ones already available. SSI will play an important role in the future of authentication and impact most actors of the digital world.

## What is SSI?

Self-Sovereign Identity is a **user-centric model of digital identity** that gives individuals full control over the creation, management, and use of their digital identities, without reliance on centralized authorities. 

It ensures that individuals can present verifiable credentials in a digital format and interact in the digital world with the same freedom and capacity for trust as they do in the offline world.

### The Core Principles of SSI

SSI is built upon several core principles that distinguish it from traditional identity management systems:

- **Existence**: Users must have an independent existence in the digital realm.
- **Control**: Users must control their identities, with the ability to access and manage their own data.
- **Access**: Users should always have access to their own data and consent to its use.
- **Transparency**: Systems and algorithms must be transparent, allowing users to understand identity system functions.
- **Persistence**: Identities must be long-lasting and not dependent on any single third-party authority.
- **Portability**: Information and identities should be transportable and not be locked into a single platform.
- **Interoperability**: Identities should be usable across multiple platforms and jurisdictions.
- **Consent**: Users must agree to the use of their identity data.
- **Minimalization**: Disclosure of claims must be minimized to the amount necessary for the task.
- **Protection**: The rights of users must be protected.

### Why SSI Matters as the Next Step After OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 revolutionized third-party authorization by allowing users to grant apps access to their information without sharing passwords. However, it still operates within a framework where **identity information is stored in centralized silos**, creating potential vulnerabilities and control by third-party service providers.

SSI moves beyond this by enabling a **peer-to-peer exchange of data** where trust is established through **cryptographic proofs**, reducing reliance on centralized systems and mitigating many of the risks associated with them.

It also promises to enhance privacy and prevents identity theft by ensuring that users only share the specific data that is needed, using verifiable credentials.

## Impacts of SSI

The implications of SSI are broad and potentially transformative:

- **Privacy**: Enhanced user privacy, as SSI allows for selective disclosure of attributes rather than entire identity profiles.
- **Security**: Reduced risk of data breaches, since personal data is not centrally stored.
- **User Experience**: Simplified verification processes, with no need for multiple usernames and passwords.
- **Inclusion**: The potential to provide secure digital identities to those who currently lack access to online services.

Self-Sovereign Identity marks a shift towards a more secure, private, and user-friendly method of managing digital identities. 

As adoption grows, it could very well redefine the landscape of digital interactions, trust, and online freedom.
